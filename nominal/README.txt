Sitting in this folder we have nominal CMB power spectra. The folders WITHIN this folder, however, are a different story.

Omega_b directories assume we vary Omega_b but hold Omega_m CONSTANT. So if we bump Omega_b up by. 0.01, we bump Omega_c DOWN by 0.01 to keep the sum of the two, Omega_m, as a constant. Step values for “long” are +/1 0.01. Step values for “short” are +/1 0.001

Omega_m directories, however, assume that we’ve changed Omega_m altogether. We keep Omega_b at its nominal value, and only vary Omega_c in order to change the overall Omega_m. We use omega_c to absorb the degeneracy, allowing us to treat omega_b and omega_m as effectively independent parameters. Step values for “long” are +/1 0.01 and “short” are +/- 0.001.

h_0 directories are pretty obvious, they vary h_0. Step values for “long” are +/1 0.01 and “short” are +/- 0.001.
